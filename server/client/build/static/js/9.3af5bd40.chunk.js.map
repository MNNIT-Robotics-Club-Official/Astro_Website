We have organized various events, quizzes, and classes with some participation of 100+ participants and own a telescope for observations. Many individuals have completed their projects under the guidance of club instructors in topics ranging from 3D printing a telescope, machine learning in astronomy to orbital mechanics, astronomy data processing, and so on. Apart from projects, our members frequently click pictures of celestial objects and star trails. Our wing has boomed well under the guidance of revered professionals and parent club AeroClub.\r\n            We are continuously striving towards merging our prowess in technology with our passion for astronomy and aspire to share the spirit with you.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className=\"col col-image\" data-aos=\"zoom-in\">\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n    </section>\r\n\r\n  )\r\n}"],"sourceRoot":""}
